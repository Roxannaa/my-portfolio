# 🌐 Roxanna Alburquerque – Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio!

This portfolio showcases a collection of my personal projects, built independently as part of my learning journey and passion for software development.
Although I have professional experience working on real-world platforms and production-level applications, the projects featured here represent work I’ve done outside my jobs, simply because I enjoy creating, experimenting, and improving my skills.

Through this site, I highlight the technologies I use, the things I’ve built for fun and growth, and a bit of who I am as a developer.
